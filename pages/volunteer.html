<p>
    Hammerwood Scout Campsite is managed by a team of volunteers - and there’s always room for extra help! 
</p>
<p>
    We have ‘Hands On, Help Out’ days throughout the year and friends of Hammerwood Scout Campsite are encouraged to join us. Please sign up to our newsletter to be kept in the loop about upcoming events. 
</p>
<p>
    If you’re keen to help in other ways, on a one-off or more regular basis, please get in touch via hammerwoodscouts@gmail.com to arrange to speak to a member of the committee.
