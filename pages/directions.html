<h1>How to Find Us</h1>
<p>
	Hammerwood is located off the A264, between East Grinstead and Holtye. Follow
	the signs for Hammerwood Park into Hammerwood hamlet. Travel down the wiggly
	road and when you pass the barns on the left you need to take a right turn, at Bower House,
	before the sign marked &quot;private road&quot;. Travel down the track past
	the fields until you reach the campsite. On entering the campsite, you must
	immediately turn right into the car park. (Note: this track is not suitable
	for anything larger than an ordinary width minibus.)
