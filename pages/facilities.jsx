				Hammerwood Scout Campsite offers a dynamic site suitable for a host of
				activities. Do get in touch with us to discuss your individual needs and
				weâ€™ll be able to confirm if our facilities meet your requirements. There
				is step-free access to the hut, the lodge and the toilet block with
				accessible parking available.
			</p>
			<h2>Accommodation</h2>
			<p>
				<h3>The Hut</h3>
				The Hut comprises a hall, catering kitchen and laundry facilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				The hut is often used for catering, training, and indoor activities. The
				hall offers a flexible space with enough room to cater for around 20
				people with fold-away tables and stackable chairs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The stainless steel catering kitchen is well-equipped for both small and
				larger groups. It includes an industrial size gas oven, with 6 large
				hobs and an industrial electric fridge. Please note there is no freezer
				on site.
			</p>
			<p>
				The lobby of the hut offers seating and shoe storage, as well a laundry
				area with double sink, washing machine and tumble drier.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>The Lodge</h3>
				The Lodge comprises 22 bunks divided into 3 rooms (16 bunks, 4 bunks, 2
				bunks). The lodge has storage heaters which warm up while the generator
				is running.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>Toilet Block</h3>
				There is a toilet block for all users of the site. We are currently
				fundraising for a shower block!
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note: The site does not currently have grid power, so the
				electricity for the site is powered via a diesel generator. This
				typically only runs for a few hours in the morning, and in the evening.
				Hot water is only available whilst the generator is on, and for a while
				afterwards. The diesel expense is included in accommodation prices,
				however please contact us if you would require electricity throughout
				the day.
